This project comprises of all the Flutter Development and related tools done by me. 
Flutter is a hybrid framework developed by Google for making apps for Android and iOS system.

## How to get started with Flutter


This is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) project created with [`Flutter SDK`](https://flutter.dev/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw2Je1BhAgEiwAp3KY7wO64MLEMuDGbUD3FrG3m5nguC0MflVYlflBiA_4SHQT4sJA_WcFMRoC6SoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) I have added all my practice of Flutter appplication here.


1. Install Flutter SDK and set path in your EV in Machine.


2. Check Flutter Doctor and see what requirement you're yet to meet. 

3. Once you finished set up you can either run this app from Android Studio or VS Code (I recommend VS)
